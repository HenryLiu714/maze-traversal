# Maze Traversal Visualizer

A visualization program that is capable of generating random mazes of variable size then solve them using a variety of common graph traveral techniques. The solving process is shown with varying speeds on the graphics program.

- The maze is generated using depth-first search and recursive backtracking
- The graphics of the maze are rendered using the Raylib library
